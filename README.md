# Amazon Customers Sentiment Analysis\

In the ever-evolving landscape of the retail industry, understanding customer sentiments and opinions is paramount to success. As a response to this need, this report outlines a self-directed project aimed at assisting a chosen retail entity in harnessing the power of text mining to extract valuable insights from product reviews. The primary objective of this project is to design and implement a robust full-stack text-mining strategy that can effectively filter existing reviews into distinct positive and negative categories, thereby facilitating the classification of new reviews into these predefined segments.

The chosen approach involves working with a diverse dataset sourced from Datafiniti's Product Database, encompassing a collection of over 34,000 consumer reviews for a range of Amazon products, including popular items such as the Kindle, Fire TV Stick, and more. This dataset provides a rich pool of information, including essential product details, ratings, review text, and additional attributes, making it an ideal candidate for the development and evaluation of the proposed text-mining strategy.
